# p3ppc.expShare
A mod for P3P Steam that makes inactive party members and Personas gain exp. (Also on [GameBanana](https://gamebanana.com/mods/468734)!)

By default both inactive party members and the protagonist's Personas will get the same exp as active ones, this can be changed in the mod's configuration. If you only want Persona exp share or party member exp share just set the multiplier of the other to 0.
